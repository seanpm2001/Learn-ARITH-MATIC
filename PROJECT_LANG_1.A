"Project language file 1."
"For: seanpm2001/Learn-ARITH-MATIC."
"About."
"I decided to make ARITH-MATIC the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-ARITH-MATIC) as ARITH-MATIC is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the ARITH-MATIC programming language. It only makes sense to ARITH-MATIC the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here."
